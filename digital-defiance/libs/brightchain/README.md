# BrightChain, the Re-Make (now in TypeScript for Node.js)
See: https://github.com/BrightChain/BrightChain
The new and improved, node based BrigthChain and BrightChain Confidential Quorum

BrightChain is being fully rewritten in a TypeScript to run on Node and/or in the Browser and ties.
Alongside are the qUri social and Five by Five social (\*\*\*\*\* by \*\*\*\*\*) ideas which will ride on top of the backbone, once complete.

These are being built in a mono-repo format.
Presently this is happening under the https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/nx-monorepo repository until enough progress is made to matter where it lives,
then those sorts of decisions may be made.

## For now:
See: https://github.com/BrightChain/BrightChain-old/blob/main/README.md
as well as the two PDFs there

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Building

Run `nx build brightchain` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test brightchain` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).


### FYI
The primary author is facing life threatening health challenges and may not complete the software at all, let alone at any given pace,
however she is trying to ensure that the code is self-documenting as well as fully tested. I am approaching 70% test coverage right now.
