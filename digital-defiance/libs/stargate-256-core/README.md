# stargate-256-core

This is the core library for the Stargate 256 project. It contains the
implementation of the Stargate 256 engine.

The implementation was going to be original, but someone has done a better job,
and I would rather port a great implementation than write my own. I am not enough
of a cryptanalyst, so I will leave that to the experts.
