<h2>Language Extension</h2>
<p>LangEx is a Chrome (and derivatives like Edge) Extension to help you extend your reading comprehension in any language.</p>
<br />
<p>The main goal of this extension is to do two things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Allow right-clicking on any word or selection to provide quick access to definitions and pronunciations from API providers, language websites, and even text to speech synthesis APIs.</li>
    <li>If enabled and the page is detected as a language you are studying, every word of that language will be shaded with a color/transparency highlight indicating your knowledge level of that word from unidentifiable to mastered. Right clicking the word will also let you set your mastery level.</li>
</ol>
